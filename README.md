Tangerine Orange Flavor Classification //Project of HW design - TAIST-Tokyo Tech
Tangerine orange is a native species of Thailand. It can be used to be an ingredient in many food products. The way to select the delicious tangerine orange is quite difficult because it has to squeeze on the products that make it bruised or worst spoiled. Selecting and separate the flavor also relies on the many experiences and knowledge. So, the alternative way is using the camera with AI to detect an orange image, the color and identity of orange that can tell this orange are sweet or sour. This is very useful when used to sort out the taste of orange in the food industry, in order to allow consumers to eat the desired flavor.👩🏻‍🍳 🍊

DATASET
The dataset created by ourselves (the creator of this project). We work on 117 oranges and create a dataset by taking a photo of 4 sides of oranges on white background, so the dataset has 468 images of tangerine oranges.
